After some research, I found <a href=\"https://redis.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Redis</a> and implemented it in the backend of Ticketflipping's Django app. My work was from beginning to end, which includes setting up the Redis instance, creating the cache logic, coding the backend operations, and designing and constructing the cached tables and advanced filtering.
